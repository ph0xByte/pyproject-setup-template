Modules names should have short, all-lowercase names.  The module name may
have underscores if this improves readability.

Every module should have a docstring at the very top of the file.  The
module's docstring may extend over multiple lines.  If your docstring does
extend over multiple lines, the closing three quotation marks must be on
a line by itself, preferably preceded by a blank line.

"""Fetches rows from a Smalltable.

Retrieves rows pertaining to the given keys from the Table instance

Args:
  table_handle:
    An open smalltable.Table instance.
  keys:
    A sequence of strings representing the key of each table row to
    fetch.  String keys will be UTF-8 encoded.
  require_all_keys:

Returns:
  A dict mapping keys to the corresponding table row data
  fetched. Each row is represented as a tuple of strings. For
  example:

  {b'Serak': ('Rigel VII', 'Preparer'),
   b'Zim': ('Irk', 'Invader'),
   b'Lrrr': ('Omicron Persei 8', 'Emperor')}

  Returned keys are always bytes.  If a key from the keys argument is
  missing from the dictionary, then that row was not found in the
